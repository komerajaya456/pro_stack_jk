Routing
  i.get route(url can be              visible like image search "www.google.com/dihfbh3w48y8 id=shivudu+wallpaper+in+HD")
  ii.post route(url cant display like email,password of login)
  app.get("/routing",(req,res)=>{}) //req contain user Data[loc,ip address] 
middleware:-
  i.we can execute somethning in middle of apk.get (or) before routing

  ii.every time app.use run if we reload page(it will come again from starting)
  
Route parameters:-
  fb.com/profile/gow
  fb.com/profile/hvn
  fb.com/profile/jk
  fb.com/profile/ab
  above{fb.com/profile} #didn't need to write 4 app.get('4 routes')
  so to avoid this we use 
  
  i.Dynamic routing
  app.get('/profile/:username',(req,res=>{
    console.log(req.params)
    res.send(`hello ${req.params.username'})
  }))
